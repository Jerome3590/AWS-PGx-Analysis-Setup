## Title: 
Improving Both Hospital Operational Excellence and Patient Outcomes with Precision Medicine: A Case Study Utilizing Virginia’s All Payers Claim Database (APCD) and the FDA's Adverse Drug Event Reporting System (FAERS)

## Project Summary:

The goal of this project is to investigate how Hospitals can improve their reach and clinical capabilities by integrating precision medicine into their respective healthcare system. Specifically, we aim to use Virginia’s All Payers Claim Database (APCD) and the FDA's Adverse Drug Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify opportunities and challenges for implementing precision medicine at the patient level for both hospital and patient operational excellence.

## Specific Aims:

### Aim 1: Assess the Current Status of precision medicine machine learning models implemented into hospital information systems

- **Objective 1.1**: Conduct a comprehensive analysis via PubMed and other electronic means for personalized medicine machine learning models implemented at scale.
  
- **Objective 1.2**: Analyze PubMed and other electronic means to determine impact or known benefits (improvements in quality, capacity, and performance) as well as any gaps to achieving operational performance and quality improvements.


### Aim 2: Build a Precision Risk Model for Opioid Events
  
- **Objective 2.1**: Use APCD data to train a machine learning model based on ICD Code F11.20 to identify key features that can be used to identify high risk patients for future opioid ED visits.


### Aim 3: Build a Precision Risk Model for Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)

- **Objective 3.1**: Use FAERS data to assess the prevalence and types of adverse drug events occurring in the hospital.
  
- **Objective 3.2**: Use APCD data to assess the prevalence and types of adverse drug events occurring in the hospital.

- **Objective 3.3**: Use data from APCD and FAERS to build a model that identifies previously undocumented ADEs in the APCD as well as predict future ADEs based on drug combination and other FAERS/APCD claim data elements.


### Aim 4: Develop an Implementation Framework for Integrating Precision Medicine Machine Learning Models into Hospital Information Systems with FHIR

- **Objective 4.1**: Develop a data strategy and data model to continually collect, secure, and validate the necessary data to support machine learning models. Data strategy will also include data gaps and important initiatives to continually enhance and improve the data quality and data available for machine learning models.
  
- **Objective 4.2**: Provide a proof of concept information technology (IT) solution that integrates a machine learning model with data from a patient's mobile phone and hospital EHR system for a near real time personalized medicine machine learning model prediction.
